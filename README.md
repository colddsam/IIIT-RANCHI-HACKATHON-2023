About us: We are Team Dark Phoenix from Kolkata, West Bengal. Currently we pursuing B.tech degree from Narula Institute of Technology in ECE. Grow, Explore more and transform the impossible into real life is our main mantra.

Objective of our Model: Across us there are many people around us who cannot able to hear any thing or cannot say anything. According to Wikipedia there are 63 million across us who have hard hearing problem and the number is raising rapidly day by day. and it found to very difficult to communicate with them in normal language and it also applicable for vice versa.

Approach used our project: Thus we approaching to made this model. Here we dealing for both condition. For a normal human with a deaf and vice-versa. Means we have 2 models in one project.
a>> Sign Language to Speech Conversion
b>> Speech to Sign language Conversion
In first model we used a CNN based Machine Learning approach to detect the sign conversion. Where the model achived above 97.62% accuracy with 0.08% loss of our training model. Just for a general overview we taking the each frame of the input video and processing it through our model and showing the corresponding result or letter.
In our second model we created a basic GUI using tkinter to create an interface where we show the sign language posture image of hand, corresponding to the each letter. It also have a interface for directly transform text to sign language using same GUI. In this model we firstly taking the audio or text input from the user then transform it into the corresponding sign language.

Tech Stack: CNN, ML, Tkinter, Pyaudio, Speech-Recognition, pyttsx3, Tensorflow, Skitlearn

Application: It will be helpful for the person who have hearing deficiency to communicate with the society and also help the others to communicate with them.
